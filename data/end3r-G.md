The _execute function has an insufficiently low gas limit. 

If this function is called with a large number of inputs, it could cause the contract to run out of gas and fail. This could be addressed by increasing the gas limit for this function.

Recommendations

The gas limit for the _execute function should be increased to ensure that it can handle a sufficient number of inputs without running out of gas.
