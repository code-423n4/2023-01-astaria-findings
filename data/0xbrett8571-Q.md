## Title: 
Incorrect return value for `supportsInterface` function

## Description:
The `supportsInterface` function in the smart contract does not return the correct value for the interfaces it supports. It is currently hardcoded to always return false, regardless of the input passed to it.

## Impact:
This may cause confusion or issues for external contracts interacting with this contract, as they may expect the correct interfaces to be returned. However, it does not directly affect the security of this contract.

## Proof of Concept:

```
contract Test {
    function testSupportsInterface() public view returns (bool) {
        return IERC165(address(this)).supportsInterface(0x01ffc9a7);
    }
}
```
When this function is called, it will always return false, even if the smart contract actually supports the IERC165 interface.

## Mitigation:
To fix this issue, the `supportsInterface` function should be updated to correctly return whether the contract supports the provided interface or not. This can be done by implementing a mapping of supported interfaces and checking if the input is present in the mapping.

```
    mapping(bytes4 => bool) internal supportedInterfaces;
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) public pure returns (bool) {
        return supportedInterfaces[interfaceID];
    }
```
This code should be added to the contract and the supported interfaces should be added to the mapping in the constructor.

## Testing:
To test this, the contract should be deployed and the `supportsInterface` function should be called with different interfaces to check if it returns correct values.

## Conclusion:
The `supportsInterface` function not returning the correct value may cause confusion or issues for external contracts interacting with this contract, but it does not directly affect the security of this contract. This issue can be easily fixed by adding the correct implementation for the `supportsInterface` function.
