## Solmate's contract existence check
As denoted by [File: SafeTransferLib.sol#L9](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/blob/main/src/utils/SafeTransferLib.sol#L9):

```
/// @dev Note that none of the functions in this library check that a token has code at all! That responsibility is delegated to the caller.
```
As such, the following token transfers associated with Solmate's `SafeTransferLib.sol`, are some of the instances performing [low-level calls without confirming contractâ€™s existence that could return success even though no function call was executed](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions):

[File: TransferProxy.sol#L34](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-astaria/blob/main/src/TransferProxy.sol#L34)

```solidity
    ERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(from, to, amount);
```
[File: Vault.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-astaria/blob/main/src/Vault.sol)

```solidity
66:    ERC20(asset()).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

72:    ERC20(asset()).safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, amount);
```
## Camel casing input parameter names
Input parameter names should be conventionally camel cased where possible.

Here are some of the instances entailed:

[File: TransferProxy.sol#L24](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-astaria/blob/main/src/TransferProxy.sol#L24)

```diff
-  constructor(Authority _AUTHORITY) Auth(msg.sender, _AUTHORITY) {
+  constructor(Authority _authority) Auth(msg.sender, _authority) {
```
## Camel/snake casing function names
Function names should also be conventionally camel cased where possible. If snake case is preferred/adopted, consider lower casing them.

Here are some of the instances entailed:

[File: AstariaVaultBase.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-astaria/blob/main/src/AstariaVaultBase.sol)

```
50:  function START() public pure returns (uint256) {

54:  function EPOCH_LENGTH() public pure returns (uint256) {

58:  function VAULT_FEE() public pure returns (uint256) {

62:  function COLLATERAL_TOKEN() public view returns (ICollateralToken) {
```
## Wrong method called
`name()` in Vault.sol, WithdrawProxy.sol, and PublicVault.sol have their ERC20 instance externally and erroneously calling `symbol()` instead of `name()`.

Consider having their respective errors fixed as follows:

[File: Vault.sol#L28-L36](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-astaria/blob/main/src/Vault.sol#L28-L36)

```diff
  function name()
    public
    view
    virtual
    override(VaultImplementation)
    returns (string memory)
  {
-    return string(abi.encodePacked("AST-Vault-", ERC20(asset()).symbol()));
+    return string(abi.encodePacked("AST-Vault-", ERC20(asset()).name()));
  }
```
[File: WithdrawProxy.sol#L103-L111](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-astaria/blob/main/src/WithdrawProxy.sol#L103-L111)

```diff
  function name()
    public
    view
    override(IERC20Metadata, WithdrawVaultBase)
    returns (string memory)
  {
    return
-      string(abi.encodePacked("AST-WithdrawVault-", ERC20(asset()).symbol()));
+      string(abi.encodePacked("AST-WithdrawVault-", ERC20(asset()).name()));
  }
```
[File: PublicVault.sol#L76-L84](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-astaria/blob/main/src/PublicVault.sol#L76-L84)

```diff
  function name()
    public
    view
    virtual
    override(IERC20Metadata, VaultImplementation)
    returns (string memory)
  {
-    return string(abi.encodePacked("AST-Vault-", ERC20(asset()).symbol()));
+    return string(abi.encodePacked("AST-Vault-", ERC20(asset()).name()));
  }
```
## string.concat over abi.encodePacked
Solidity ^0.8.12 introduced `string.concat()` featuring better code readability than `abi.encodePacked()`.

Here are some of the instances entailed:

[File: Vault.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-astaria/blob/main/src/Vault.sol)

```diff
- 35:    return string(abi.encodePacked("AST-Vault-", ERC20(asset()).symbol()));
+ 35:    return string.concat("AST-Vault-", ERC20(asset()).symbol());

- 46:      string(abi.encodePacked("AST-V", owner(), "-", ERC20(asset()).symbol()));
+ 46:      string.concat("AST-V", owner(), "-", ERC20(asset()).symbol());
```
## Non-compliant contract layout with Solidity's Style Guide
According to Solidity's Style Guide below:

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/style-guide.html

In order to help readers identify which functions they can call, and find the constructor and fallback definitions more easily, functions should be grouped according to their visibility and ordered in the following manner:

constructor, receive function (if exists), fallback function (if exists), external, public, internal, private

And, within a grouping, place the `view` and `pure` functions last.

Additionally, inside each contract, library or interface, use the following order:

type declarations, state variables, events, modifiers, functions

Consider adhering to the above guidelines for all contract instances entailed in the code bases.

## Typo mistakes
[File: Vault.sol#L90](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-astaria/blob/main/src/Vault.sol#L90)

```diff
-    //invalid action private vautls can only be the owner or strategist
+    //invalid action private vaults can only be the owner or strategist
```
## Empty blocks
Function with empty block should have a comment explaining why it is empty, or an event emitted.

Here are some of the instances entailed:

[File: ClearingHouse.sol#L104](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-astaria/blob/main/src/ClearingHouse.sol#L104)

```solidity
  function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) external {}
```
[File: ClearingHouse.sol#L180-L186](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-astaria/blob/main/src/ClearingHouse.sol#L180-L186)

```solidity
  function safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] calldata ids,
    uint256[] calldata amounts,
    bytes calldata data
  ) public {}
```
## Use `delete` to clear variables
`delete a` assigns the initial value for the type to `a`. i.e. for integers it is equivalent to `a = 0`, but it can also be used on arrays, where it assigns a dynamic array of length zero or a static array of the same length with all elements reset. For structs, it assigns a struct with all members reset. Similarly, it can also be used to set an address to zero address or a boolean to false. It has no effect on whole mappings though (as the keys of mappings may be arbitrary and are generally unknown). However, individual keys and what they map to can be deleted: If `a` is a mapping, then `delete a[x]` will delete the value stored at x.

The delete key better conveys the intention and is also more idiomatic.

For instance, the `a = false` instance below may be refactored as follows:

[File: VaultImplementation.sol#L106](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-astaria/blob/main/src/VaultImplementation.sol#L106)

```diff
-    _loadVISlot().allowListEnabled = false;
+    delete _loadVISlot().allowListEnabled;
```
## Deprecated code
As denoted in [Solidity Documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/080-breaking-changes.html#silent-changes-of-the-semantics):

"... The pragma pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2; is still valid, but it is deprecated and has no effect. If you want to be explicit, please use pragma abicoder v2; instead."

Consider the removing the deprecated code line in the contract instance below:

[File: CollateralToken.sol#L16](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-astaria/blob/main/src/CollateralToken.sol#L16)

```diff
- pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;
```
