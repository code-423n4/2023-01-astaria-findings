Low Impact Risks:
```
  //revert no auction
      revert InvalidCollateralState(InvalidCollateralStates.NO_AUCTION);
    }
    if (
      s.collateralIdToAuction[collateralId] != keccak256(abi.encode(params))
    ) {
```
https://github.com/AstariaXYZ/astaria-core/blob/master/src/CollateralToken.sol

    The code uses the keccak256() function to compare the input params to the stored collateralIdToAuction value. It would be more secure to use a constant-time comparison function to prevent timing attacks.

The keccak256() function is a hashing function that is used to compute the SHA-3 hash of the input data. In this case, the code is using the function to compute the hash of the params input and comparing it to the stored collateralIdToAuction value.

A timing attack is a type of side-channel attack where an attacker can infer information about a system by measuring the time it takes for the system to perform a certain operation. In this case, if an attacker can measure the time it takes for the contract to compare the input params to the stored collateralIdToAuction value, they might be able to infer information about the stored value.

To prevent timing attacks, it would be more secure to use a constant-time comparison function. A constant-time comparison function always takes the same amount of time to execute, regardless of the input values being compared. This means that an attacker would not be able to infer information about the stored value by measuring the time it takes for the comparison to be made.

A popular constant-time comparison function is require(memcmp(a,b,length) == 0) this function compares two memory slices of bytes and returns true if they are equal and false otherwise. This function is constant time, so even if an attacker can measure the time it takes for the comparison to be made, they would not be able to infer information about the stored value.
It's important to note that this is just one example and other ways of achieving constant time comparison exist.
